## What Worked Well

- Followed short assignment instructions to get ESLint, Babel, Webpack and NPM installed correctly

## What Didn't

## References

[Get Favicon to show in local development environment with `HtmlWebpackPlugin`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47573912/webpack-dev-server-favicon-not-showing-on-localhost-but-works-on-external-url#answer-60351342)

## Overrides

- Made edits to ESLint configuration to allow for tabs
- Made edits to ESLint configuration to enforce use of double quotes

## Extra Credit

- Added [`imagemin-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/image-minimizer-webpack-plugin) for image optimization
